# Psion2Adventure
A small adventure game for the Psion 2 LZ/64 programmed in OPL

Usually the code and OPK's here are stable, but for a while will not be complete - this is a work in progress :)

You can download CURSUS.OPK and use it standalone in Jape (https://www.jaapsch.net/psion/jape/jape.htm)
